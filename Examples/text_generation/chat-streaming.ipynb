      "* **Model:** Based on the learned patterns, the algorithms build a mathematical model that can make predictions, classifications, or recommendations.\n",
      "* **Training:** The model is trained on a massive dataset, allowing it to learn the underlying structure of the data.\n",
      "* **Testing:** Once trained, the model is tested on unseen data to evaluate its accuracy andgeneralizability.\n",
